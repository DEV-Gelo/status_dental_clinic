In our clinic, we pay special attention to the diagnostic stage, as the accuracy of diagnostics determines the effectiveness of subsequent treatment. Diagnostics in our clinic include both visual examination and the use of modern digital equipment: intraoral cameras, dental X-rays, orthopantomograms (panoramic images), and 3D tomography. These methods provide a complete picture of the oral cavity condition: teeth, bone tissue, gums, joints, and other structures. Even the smallest lesions — cracks, hidden carious cavities, early stages of periodontitis — are carefully detected. The diagnostic procedure takes minimal time and causes no discomfort to the patient. Our doctors work carefully, explaining each stage of the examination and the results. We strive for the patient to not only receive information but also understand its significance.",
